# pyNetGL
Python library to display networkx objects in openGL

Simple set of routines for rendering NetworkX geometric networks in OpenGL. Not sure if it still works, was done as a part of my Master's work in ~2010. The associated libraries have changed a great deal, but this might still be useful.
